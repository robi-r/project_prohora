For the demonstration purpose the below equipments has been used:

1. Arduino Uno R3 microcontroller
2. GSM SIM800L Module
3. Water Sensor
4. Ultrasonic sensor HC-SR04(will be used for much more accurate data, not used in codes)
5. 3.7V (Li-on battery) (4pcs), 5V DC Power Source.
6. Passive Buzzer
7. LED
8. Jumper Wires
9. Prototype Bread Boards.
10. GSM SIM.


Software and Libraries:

1. Arduino IDE
2. SoftwareSerial library.


For Demonstration purpose we have created an environment by using Clay, hard boards, foams, color paints.
